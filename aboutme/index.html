    <h2>Just call me Collin</h2>
    <p>Hey ya'll! I'm from Austin, Texas. I have lived here for about 8 months now and love it.
        I live here with my wife Amanda and our labradoodle Tucker. I love the outdoors and love
        making things out of wood or metal. I love creating things and fixing whatever I can get
        my hands on. That has led me down a path of getting a bachelors in software engineering.
        I have loved coding and designing things in a different way than I usually do things.
