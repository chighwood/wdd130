            <h1>Highwood Handicrafts</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Highwood Handicrafts! My booth at Wimberly Market Days consist of handmade wooden decorations that have a country antique feel to them. I use whatever type of wood I can get my hands on from scrap wood to free wooden pallets I get from whoever is getting rid of them. I design and make them by myself along with my wife. I have made many different sizes and shapes according to whatever design we come up with. I also do custom ones if someone has something particular in mind. </p>
