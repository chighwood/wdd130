      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Main page - To really introduce the reason for the page. I want those who read the page to know what Wimberly Market Days is and what it is. I would like to have pictures of different booths and shops there. Maybe try to include their Facebook page and Instagram pages if they have them. I want to also inform visitors of what all it includes, like vendors, food, live music, and just the feeling of being a part of a small-town market like this. It is also there to bring attention to places like this to visit at some point if you ever have a chance. I want to make the page feel welcoming and feel like a nice place to take the family. I would like to share what type of food will be there. This is Texas so BBQ is the thing to eat when you are here. They have a place you can sit at and eat lunch while having live music in the background. I am going to share how there are 490 booths with so many different things to look at and buy. It’s also just a cool atmosphere. I want to have lots of pictures of what some of the booths look like and also the stuff you are able to buy there. From the home baked goods to things like a piece of pretty wood or a funny sign.

      </ul>
      <h3>Highwood Handycrafts</h3>
      <p>
        2nd page - On this page, I want to introduce you to my craft booth. I want to show people what kind of homemade things are at that booth. Pictures of what kind of things they’ll find and what they could expect to find. I will also do different projects depending on the size and shape. From the type of wood, the width and height, the color and stain options, and even the design. There are so many things you can do out of wood with your imagination and it’s fun to see what you can come up with. My focus with the art will be barn quilt style blocks and wider mountain scenes. I also want to help people realize what beauties you can make out of scrap or unused wood. I will also have lots of pictures of things that I have also made that will be there. I will have different categories of the types of art and what it will look like. I want to do 2 columns of different projects. Probably 4 in total. Big enough to see but small enough to be able to see all of them on the page at a time. (on a computer screen)

      </ul>
      <h3>Maps/Directions</h3>
      <p>
        3rd page - The last page of my website will consist of a map of the grounds of where market days is and the directions to get there. I want to be able to explain where it is at here in Texas and when it is at. It’s not one of those places that you would probably travel from state to state to go to, but it is a nice little community thing that’s been going on for a long time. I want to also share about parking and how that works. What time they open and they close. How long you can expect to be there. What you should bring. Like having a cart to put items in so that you don’t have to carry everything or go back to the car to drop it off. I want to start with the time it opens and closes. Next, I want to put the address and a picture of a map of the area it would be in. Lastly, I want a map of market days the width of the screen so you can see all of the booths.
